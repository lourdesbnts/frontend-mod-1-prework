## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I wait too long honestly but I'm learning that it's ok to speak up when you're stuck.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I felt overwhelmed but it's a great way to learn and figure out what works best for you in this process. The fact that there was no directions given was uncomfortable I was like what! I just read and re read everything, googled and youtubed a lot.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

They are if, else, and else if statements. A daily life conditional would be if I wake up at 6:00am I can go to the gym, else if I wake up after 6:00am I cannot got to the gym. A web app where it is probably used would be a dating app, if you're over 18 you can sign up, if you're under 18 then you may not.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

You would use else if, and else concepts. The program reads the first condition, if it returns false it checks the condition of the else if statement and so on until it returns true. If they all return false it would print the final else statement.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

You can use logical operators in your condition.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
