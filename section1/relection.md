## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

The part where it says "When you maintain an open mind and an enthusiasm to learn new skills, you set yourself apart as someone who's knowledgable and curious." really stood out to me because I believe when you get stuck in old ways or old views you never grow as a person or get to where you want to be in life because of it. The only thing I do already is read. I want to incorporate better eating habits since I started to notice some of the food I eat makes me feel sluggish. Causing me to not put my full attention to class. *It's just so easy to make a cup of noodles*... Also taking more breaks. Adopting the pomodoro technique to step away from the computer when I can't figure something out. It so far helps with coming back refreshed and being able to figure out my problem.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

* __Strings__  contains a sequence of characters that are in quotation marks.
* __Numbers__ whole numbers (no fractions) that can be positive, negative, or zero and they cannot have decimal places.
* __Booleans__ it's value can only be true or false. Used only for creating true or false statements.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

`console.log("Hello World!");``

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

You use two forward slashes example: // The purpose is so the console doe not run whatever you put after the forward slashes and for you to be able to explain what your code does like comments.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is a place where you can add data or information into it.
Think of variable like a container you can name and then you take your information and store it into your container.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Instagram
`var numberOfLikes` - number data type
`var followers` - string data type
`var likedPosts` - number data type

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Joining two strings together.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

Spotify might use concatention in Your Library by combining Playlists and Artists under it.


9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
I'm not clear on when I should be using concatenation or interpolation to log strings. Or is this just preference?
