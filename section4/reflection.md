## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

Not very different still kinda stressed out.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

Yeah I guess I was able to focus on one thing at a time. This was the most difficult section and I'm not feeling very confident about it but it was good to step away from the screen more often that usual. I estimated my time waaaaaay off.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

Objects represent things with properties and Arrays store lists of data in a single variable.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  Array, because it would just be a list of names.

  * List of states and their capitals
  Object because it has multiple data to be stored.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  Object because it would need to store multiple data.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  Array because it's just a list of accounts.
  * List of student names and their cohort
  Object it has multiple data to store.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  Object it has multiple data to store.
  * All my favorite restaurants
Array, just a list of restaurants.
1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
Venmo
Keys: Transfer Money, Add Recipients, Top People
Values: Recieved From, Type of Transaction, Transaction ID

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
I'm not sure how I would word my questions. Thats something I'm working on because I'm really bad at it but I need to understand better on what I am doing because it was really tough for me.
