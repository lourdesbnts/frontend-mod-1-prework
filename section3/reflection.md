## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
Love how it points out believing in yourself you can improve your skills with effort and practice since that is something I struggle with. Also how seeking for help is a sign of strength, never looked at it that way before.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
Well its taken a lot of effort but asking for help is a thing I am practicing more. Before I thought asking for help would make me look dumb but I remember that this is a whole new subject I am learning and it's ok to ask if I'm stuck on something.
I don't demonstrate a growth mindset by practicing S.M.A.R.T goals. Something I am working on especially once Mod 1 starts. I feel like it'll be a big struggle if I don't based on what I've read from others that have gone through the program. 

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
TikTok. Main profile with different lists like your posted videos, loved videos, private videos.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
Array methods help developers handle arrays easily and efficiently.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
The purpose of a loop is so programmers do not have to type the same code over and over again x amount of times.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
Loops are used to perform repeated tasks based on your condition.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
